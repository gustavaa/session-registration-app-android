# Session registration app Android
This is a project I made for the section of Computer Science at Link√∂ping University. It was part of a voting system for the seciton meetings and was used to keep track of members that attended the meeting and therefore had the right to vote on different matters.

The app connects to a voting session by scanning a QR-code or by manually entering the details of the session. Members could then be registered by scanning their personal university card through NFC.
